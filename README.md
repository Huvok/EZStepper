# EZStepper
Library for stepper motors control using Arduino, used to control the motors movement through a 4-bit driver. Tested and developed using a 28BYJ-48 â€“ 5V Stepper Motor with its ULN2003-style driver.

To include the library into your Arduino project:

```
1.  Download or clone repository.
2.  Move the src folder to you Arduino libraries directory (by default in Documents/Arduino/Libraries.
3.  Rename the src folder to something significative (Optional) e.g. EZStepper
4.  Open your arduino project, go to Sketch->Include Library, then scroll down until you find the correct folder name (src or depending on what you choose in step 3.).
```

There is an example project where you can see how to use the library, however feel free to play around to see other ways to implement it.
